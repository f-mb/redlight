For new menus, sections or social links, the following icons are included in RedLight:

<img src="redlight/icons/icons.png"/>

#### Customize Layout

By default, RedLight use a grey-based layout; but you can customize it.

To do so, create a "customize.css" file (use code in "tpl-customize.css"; uncomment parts you want to customize; do not delete "!important" mentions!).

No other action needed. The "customize.css" will be automatically load by RedLight.

*Recommandation:* Use only one different color, called "On Color" in "tpl-customize.css".
